I'm a 24 years-old guy from Guatemala, passionate about psychology, astronomy, nature, nerd stuff, and programming.
One of my goals is to become a great front-end developer and make a living from it.
But you maybe ask, why? Because I am fascinated as much as I admire well-designed, aesthetically pleasing, interactive webpages that
work as intended but are easy to navigate and understand.
I believe a well-designed webpage makes the difference between grabbing your reader's attention or scaring them away. That's why I'm
willing to give my best every time I program and design a webpage. Because I believe quality makes the difference.
With that brief introduction, I welcome you to my portfolio webpage. Enjoy :)
